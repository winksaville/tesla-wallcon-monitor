# tesla-wallcon-monitor

A CLI tool to monitor a Tesla Wall Connector.

This was created with `claude code opus 4.5` and I use a local directory,
[./.claude](./.claude), to preserve claude-code musings.
If you'd like to do the same for this or any other repo I created
`claude-symlink.sh` which adds symlink's to `~/.claude/projects/`.
If you have a default claude code installation you can run
`claude-symlink.sh ./.claude`. For details see
[https://github.com/winksaville/claude-symlink.sh](https://github.com/winksaville/claude-symlink.sh).

## Usage

```bash
tesla-wallcon-monitor [OPTIONS] <ADDR> <COMMAND>
```

### Options

- `-l, --loop-mode` - Continuously update display (vitals only). Press ESC or Ctrl+C to exit.
- `-d, --delay <SECONDS>` - Delay between updates in loop mode (default: 5).
- `--log <FILE>` - Log raw JSON responses with timestamps to a file for later processing.
- `-h, --help` -  Print help

### Commands

Commands can be abbreviated to their minimum unique prefix:

| Abbrev | Command      | Description                              |
|--------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| l      | lifetime     | Display lifetime statistics              |
| ve     | version      | Display firmware and device information  |
| vi     | vitals       | Display real-time charging status        |
| w      | wifi_status  | Display WiFi connection status           |

### Examples

```bash
$ tesla-wallcon-monitor --help

#### Here is a Gen 3 WC that causes a PCS_a052 error

This is with a non-working Gen 3 WC writing to [./data/logs3-d-2.txt](./data/logs3-d-2.txt),
the most obvious issue is **vehicle_current_a is always 0.0**.

```bash
$ tesla-wallcon-monitor -l -d 2 --log data/logs3-d-2.txt
```

* vehicle_connected changes from false to true:
```bash

* We see vehicle_connected change from false to true and right after contactor_close change from false to true but still vehicle_current_a is 0.0:

* vehicle_current_a never changes and then we see vehicle_connected goes true to false back to true and session_s changes to 0 and then starts increasing, **I beleve this was an automatic retry**
