I'm Claude Code, operating in read-only mode. I can efficiently search through files, analyze code, and provide insights about the repository structure and implementation.\n\nI can see this is a Rust CLI tool for monitoring Tesla Wall Connectors. Based on the CLAUDE.md file, the project:\n- Uses Cargo for building (with a release binary option)\n- Takes a wall connector address as an argument\n- Leverages clap, reqwest, and serde for parsing arguments, making HTTP requests, and handling JSON\n\nI'm currently on the `wip` branch and the repository is in a clean state.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase? I can help you:\n- Find specific files or implementations\n- Understand code structure and architecture\n- Locate functions, types, or configuration\n- Analyze how components interact\n- Review recent changes or commits\n\nJust let me know what you're looking for!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1163,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWdJGexwq3mvB3kRMRMcG","type":"assistant","uuid":"22e123ac-81e2-4c14-9bb0-64706cb5eb04","timestamp":"2025-12-30T17:53:11.378Z"}
